# Agent PMO Workflow — Agent Instructions

> ⚠️ **TOKEN DISCIPLINE.** Check file size first. `Grep` over `Read`. Use `offset`/`limit`.
> Smallest diff that solves the problem. Delete dead code, unused imports, stale comments.
> Call out irrelevant context before proceeding. Bloat degrades reasoning. ⚠️

> Read this entire file before making changes.

> ⚠️ **ACT AUTONOMOUSLY. DO NOT STOP TO ASK THE USER QUESTIONS.** When something is
> ambiguous, choose the most reasonable default, note the assumption, and keep working to
> completion. No mid-task pauses for confirmation or approval. Deliver finished work plus a
> short summary of any assumptions made. ⚠️

## Project Overview

Agent PMO Workflow — a system for running 20+ AI agents across multiple projects simultaneously. See `README.md` for the full vision. Two components:

1. **PMO Dashboard** (`dashboard/`) — F# script that scans repos under `~/Documents/Code/` and generates an HTML status dashboard
2. **Repo Standards Enforcement** (`agent-pmo-skill/`) — portfolio-wide templates, linter configs, CI workflows, and a skill to apply consistent standards to any repo

## What This Repo Contains

- **Docs and specs** — markdown files defining the system (`README.md`, `docs/specs/REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC.md`)
- **One F# script** — `dashboard/repo-report.fsx` generates the HTML dashboard
- **Playwright E2E tests** — `dashboard/tests/repo-report.spec.js` tests the generated HTML
- **F# tests** — `dashboard/test-report.fsx` unit tests + integration test (generates report from mock repos)
- **An agent skill** — `agent-pmo-skill/SKILL.md` applies standards to other repos
- **Templates** — `agent-pmo-skill/templates/` contains configs, workflows, and instruction files for target repos

This is NOT an application codebase. Most work here is editing docs, specs, templates, and the dashboard script.

## Rules For This Workspace

- **DO NOT use git commands.** CI and GitHub Actions handle git.
- **Do not modify tests.** Fix the code until tests pass.
- **Run tests after changes.** `make test` — keep fixing until green.
- **Docs are the source of truth.** Specs define behavior. Plans define how to achieve goals. All plan docs must have a TODO checklist.
- **Templates are starting points, not copy-paste targets.** See `docs/specs/REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC.md` [MODES-CUSTOMIZE] for the customization rule.

## Portfolio-Wide Coding Standards

Hard rules, testing rules, and language-specific rules for target repos live in the templates and specs — not here:

- **Template AGENTS.md for target repos:** `agent-pmo-skill/templates/AGENTS.md`
- **Authoritative spec:** `docs/specs/REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC.md`

### Website

- Keep CSS minimal
- Total CSS budget 1.8 LOC
- Do not allow the CSS to go over this
- There are no "blog" CSS class - only PROSE classes
- All prose pages (blog, docs, etc) use the PROSE classes

When editing those files, that's where coding standards belong. This root AGENTS.md is only for working in this workspace.

## Too Many Cooks (Multi-Agent Coordination)

If the TMC server is available:
1. Register immediately: descriptive name, intent, files you will touch
2. Before editing any file: lock it via TMC
3. Broadcast your plan before starting work
4. Check messages every few minutes
5. Release locks immediately when done
6. Never edit a locked file — wait or find another approach

## Critical Reference Docs — Agent Instructions & Skills

These are the authoritative docs for configuring AI coding agents. When working on templates or the agent-pmo skill, you MUST consult the docs relevant to the target agent.

### Agent Instruction File Docs

Open standard: https://agents.md — agent-specific docs below.

| Agent | Instruction file docs |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#claude-md-files |
| OpenAI Codex | https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md |

## Build Commands

This repo follows the standard 7-target Makefile interface (REPO-STANDARDS-SPEC [MAKE-TARGETS]):

Normalize make targets according to the [conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html).

```bash
make build   # generate the HTML dashboard report
make test    # F# fixture tests + Playwright E2E (fail-fast). ONLY test entry point.
make lint    # validate Playwright test config (F# format check is a no-op)
make fmt     # format code (no-op for F# scripts)
make clean   # remove test artifacts
make ci      # lint + test + build (full CI simulation)
make setup   # install dependencies + configure (auto-detects OS)
```

Repo-specific targets (see `Repo-Specific Targets` section in the Makefile):

```bash
make dashboard              # refresh the dashboard manually
make website-build          # build the website via 11ty
make website-run            # serve the website locally with 11ty
make install-skill-claude   # install agent-pmo skill for Claude Code
make uninstall-skill-claude # remove the agent-pmo skill
make help                   # list all available targets
```

The F# and E2E sub-suites are private `_test_fsharp` / `_test_e2e` recipes called from `_test`. To debug a single test, invoke `dotnet fsi dashboard/test-report.fsx` or `cd dashboard && npx playwright test ...` directly — those are not Make targets.

## PMO Dashboard (`dashboard/`)

### How it works

1. `dashboard/repo-report.fsx` scans `~/Documents/Code/` for git repositories
2. For each repo it collects: uncommitted file count, current branch, last commit date, push status (ahead/behind), open PRs (via `gh`), CI status (via `gh`), and latest GitHub release
3. Generates a self-contained HTML report at `dashboard/repo-report.html`
4. Logs stdout to `dashboard/repo-report.log`, stderr (debug) to `dashboard/repo-report-debug.log`

### Critical: PR detection

**Open PRs must always be shown.** The PR lookup first checks for a PR matching the current branch (`--head <branch>`). If none is found, it falls back to listing any open PR in the repo. This is critical because the local branch may differ from the PR branch. The "PR Branch" column shows which branch the PR is actually from.

### launchd polling (runs every 3 minutes)

- **Plist:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentpmo.repo-report.plist`
- **Command:** `zsh -l -c "MAX_REPOS=30 dotnet fsi dashboard/repo-report.fsx"`
- **Interval:** 180 seconds
- **RunAtLoad:** true

```bash
launchctl list | grep repo-report                # check status
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentpmo.repo-report.plist  # stop
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agentpmo.repo-report.plist    # start
dotnet fsi dashboard/repo-report.fsx             # run manually
```
